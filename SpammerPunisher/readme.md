The idea is to maintain a list of email addresses of spammers who refuse to unsubscribe you.
The emailHandler fires off several emails on schedule to choke the spammers inbox!

++Added a Threading.Sleep to pause between emails.

Create an IEnumerable to iterate through a list.txt containing email addresses to punish.
