The idea is to use a REGEX to identify texts marked within "" in Sasha's paper and the pool of ebooks/pdf/epub documents.
The program should return the page number / location of the text identified within " " from the book.

To do:
Include a module that requests the conversion of the books/files into a certain format for reading. Can use Directory Poller to spot new files.
